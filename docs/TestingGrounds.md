# Testing Grounds

## What is this?

This document serves as a playground that we can use to test different styles.

Feel free to change the text below and run Vale to see what it says.

If you feel a bit more adventurous, change some of the Styles in `/styles/Vocab` and Configurations in `.vale.ini`. Then come back here and see if your new rules have applied.

## Examples for Vale

<!-- Casing -->

github

<!-- Passive Voice -->

The file must be uploaded publicly

<!-- Weasel Words  -->

Vale is very practical

<!-- Spelling Errors -->

Please fix this tpyo

<!-- Repetitions -->

It's rules like that that makes me want to try it out

<!-- Don't start sentences with 'So' -->

So, what are your plans for the day?

<!-- Don't start sentences with 'There is' -->

There is a bad way to start a sentence

<!-- Cliches -->

Using cliches will just add insult to injury
